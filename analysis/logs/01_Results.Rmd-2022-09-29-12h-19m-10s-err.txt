  GRanges object contains 2 out-of-bound ranges located on sequence chrM.
  Note that ranges located on a sequence whose length is unknown (NA) or
  on a circular sequence are not considered out-of-bound (use
  seqlengths() and isCircular() to get the lengths and circularity flags
  of the underlying sequences). You can use trim() to trim these ranges.
  See ?`trim,GenomicRanges-method` for more information.
