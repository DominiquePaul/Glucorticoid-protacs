# Analysing the use of PROTACs to target glucorticoid receptors

## What will the first questions be that I will be analysing?

### Question 1: Similarity of our RNA data with the Reddy data

(DONE)  Q: Which gene expressions have similar patterns of up-regulation (control vs. Dex) in our data compared to the Reddy data? 

*Planned approach:* Check which genes are differentially expressed in the Reddy data and create a Venn-diagram for comparable experiments with the differentially expressed genes from our analysis. Also, create a plot

### Question 2: Binding of GR-GC complex to DE genes from our analysis

(Discuss in call) Q: For the genes that our RNA-seq data shows to be DE after treatment with DEX as well as the inhibitors and control: do we see any direct TF binding to these sites? For which of these is there a difference compared to the control ChIP-seq experiment?

### Question 3: For our RNA: are there any genes that treated by the PROTAC before/after DEX that could be reversed but which could not by the inhibitors or vice versa?

(DONE) We have performed experiments where we first exposed cells to either (1) DEX (2) inhibitors or (3) KH PROTAC for a substantial time and then added inhibitors or the KH PROTAC in case (1) or DEX in cases (2) and (3). We would like to see whether the genes which were activated by DEX but the returned to a normal expression by the KH PROTAC, where a similar treatment by the inhibitors could not lead to such an effect and vice versa.

### Question 4: Binding of GR to KH PROTAC treated DE genes?

(DONE) Q: Is there a direct binding of GR to the 13 genes shown to be affected by the KH PROTAC?

### Question 5: Binding to selected genes

(DONE)Q: Does GR bind to BRCA1, Hsd11b1 and CH25H?

### Question 6: Common binding sites of JUNB and GR

Q: What are common binding sites between JUNB and GR? -> Generally not a priority though

### Question 7: PXR Sequences

Q: Does GC-GR bind to PXR sequences

Scan for PXR sequences. See if GR binds there
